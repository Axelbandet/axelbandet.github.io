# Axelnatten 2025

Swing it magistern, kandidaten och alla andra!

Axelbandet’s annual concert Axelnatten takes place on **29 March at 17:00-19:30** at Kåren in Turku.

At this festive concert, which this year has the theme *Forbidden Swing-natten*, we will play songs from our regular repertoire as well as swing interpretations of perhaps intuitively unswinging songs. Put on your dancing shoes, hold on to your hat and come along!

# Tickets for the show
