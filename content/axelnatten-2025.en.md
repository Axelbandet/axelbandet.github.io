# Axelnatten 2025

Swing it magistern, kandidaten och alla andra!

Axelbandet’s annual concert Axelnatten takes place on **29 March at 17:00-19:30** at Kåren in Turku.

At this festive concert, which this year has the theme *Forbidden Swing-natten*, we will play songs from our regular repertoire as well as swing interpretations of perhaps intuitively unswinging songs. Put on your dancing shoes, hold on to your hat and come along!

Doors open: 16:00
Concert starts: 17:00
